This repository is designed to provide some tooling to cross compile using esy to Android and iOS

## Example

To compile the hello-reason project for android arm64:

```sh
# setup
cd hello-reason
esy
node ../generate/dist/cli.js android.arm64
esy @android.arm64

# build
esy @android.arm64 not-esy-setup dune build -x android.arm64

# shell
esy @android.arm64 not-esy-setup $SHELL

## any command here will be in the env capable of building for android and host
```

## Status

Currently [Revery](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery) is used as a baseline and is tested compiling from Linux and Mac to other platforms

### Android

We can already cross compile to it and the bits that aren't possible to cross compile, namely `reason-skia` cstubs were patched for arm64.

Only arm64 was tested, but x86_64 should also be working

### iOS

Revery is working now, same as Android the `reason-skia` cstubs were patched for arm64.

Only arm64 was tested, the simulator currently is not working

## What it is

### Generate

A script and some helpers to assist esy when doing cross compilation, it's an ad-hoc solution to concentrate a some hacks to use packages that weren't originally designed to it.

### Patches

A collection of patches designed to solve packages that aren't solved by the hacks implmented on the generate or are package specific.

### Sysroot

An esy package, making the compiler + sysroot available to esy. Currently we target the following environments

| OS            | ARCH   | ENV    |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Android       | arm64  | 24     |
| iOS           | arm64  | 17.7.0 |
| iOS.simulator | x86_64 | 17.7.0 |
| Linux         | x86_64 | musl   |
